# Preliminary results from the EntoGEM project

[EntoGEM](https://entogem.github.io/) is a community-driven project that aims to compile evidence about global insect population and biodiversity status and trends. Our goal is to assess the current state of evidence in the scientific literature regarding insect declines, increases, or lack of changes over time.

Our hope is that this collection of literature, published and unpublished, will be used to inform stakeholders, such as entomologists, conservation biologists, insect enthusiasts, policy makers, or systemic review experts, and anyone who may want to learn more through a database of studies on global insect population and biodiversity trends. To do this, we will use a community-driven systematic mapping approach to determine what clusters of knowledge and gaps exist in the literature.

This repository contains code and data associated with reporting preliminary results from the project when needed for proposals or project updates. It should not be taken as a definnitive source, and is only updated as needed. For the most recent results from EntoGEM, please visit the project screening page on [SysRev](https://sysrev.com/p/16612).
